# Firestore in Native mode documentation

Firestore in Native mode is a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling, high performance, and ease of application development. While the Firestore interface has many of the same features as traditional databases, as a NoSQL database it differs from them in the way it describes relationships between data objects.

**Key Point:** Firestore now has MongoDB API compatibility. See [Firestore with MongoDB compatibility](/firestore/mongodb-compatibility/docs?) .

### [Firestore: The NoSQL Serverless Database for the Application Developer](https://research.google/pubs/pub52292/)

Firestore is a NoSQL serverless database with real-time notification capability, and together with the Firebase ecosystem it greatly simplifies common app development challenges while letting the application developer focus primarily on their business logic and user experience. This paper presents the Firestore architecture.
