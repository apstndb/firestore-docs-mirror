Starts asynchronous cancellation on a long-running operation. The server makes a best effort to cancel the operation, but success is not guaranteed. If the server doesn't support this method, it returns `  google.rpc.Code.UNIMPLEMENTED  ` . Clients can use `  Operations.GetOperation  ` or other methods to check whether the cancellation succeeded or whether the operation completed despite cancellation. On successful cancellation, the operation is not deleted; instead, it becomes an operation with an `  Operation.error  ` value with a `  google.rpc.Status.code  ` of `  1  ` , corresponding to `  Code.CANCELLED  ` .
