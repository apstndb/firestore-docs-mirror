## Resource: Index

Cloud Firestore indexes enable simple and complex queries against documents in a database.

Fields

`  name  `

`  string  `

Output only. A server defined name for this index. The form of this name for composite indexes will be: `  projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/{collectionId}/indexes/{composite_index_id}  ` For single field indexes, this field will be empty.

`  queryScope  `

`  enum ( QueryScope  ` )

Indexes with a collection query scope specified allow queries against a collection that is the child of a specific document, specified at query time, and that has the same collection id.

Indexes with a collection group query scope specified allow queries against all collections descended from a specific document, specified at query time, and that have the same collection id as this index.

`  fields[]  `

`  object ( IndexField  ` )

The fields supported by this index.

For composite indexes, this is always 2 or more fields. The last field entry is always for the field path `  __name__  ` . If, on creation, `  __name__  ` was not specified as the last field, it will be added automatically with the same direction as that of the last field defined. If the final field in a composite index is not directional, the `  __name__  ` will be ordered ASCENDING (unless explicitly specified).

For single field indexes, this will always be exactly one entry with a field path equal to the field path of the associated field.

`  state  `

`  enum ( State  ` )

Output only. The serving state of the index.
