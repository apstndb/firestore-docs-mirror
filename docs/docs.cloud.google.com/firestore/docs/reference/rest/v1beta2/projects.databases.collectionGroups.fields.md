## Resource: Field

Represents a single field in the database.

Fields are grouped by their "Collection Group", which represent all collections in the database with the same id.

Fields

`  name  `

`  string  `

A field name of the form `  projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/{collectionId}/fields/{fieldPath}  `

A field path may be a simple field name, e.g. `  address  ` or a path to fields within mapValue , e.g. `  address.city  ` , or a special field path. The only valid special field is `  *  ` , which represents any field.

Field paths may be quoted using `  (backtick). The only character that needs to be escaped within a quoted field path is the backtick character itself, escaped using a backslash. Special characters in field paths that must be quoted include:  ` \* `  ,  ` . `  , ``` (backtick),  ` \[ `  ,  ` \]\`, as well as any ascii symbolic characters.

Examples: (Note: Comments here are written in markdown syntax, so there is an additional layer of backticks to represent a code block) `  \  ` address.city\` `  represents a field named  ` address.city `  , not the map key  ` city `  in the field  ` address `  .  ` \`\*\` `  represents a field named  ` \*\`, not any field.

A special `  Field  ` contains the default indexing settings for all fields. This field's resource name is: `  projects/{projectId}/databases/{databaseId}/collectionGroups/__default__/fields/*  ` Indexes defined on this `  Field  ` will be applied to all fields which do not have their own `  Field  ` index configuration.

`  indexConfig  `

`  object ( IndexConfig  ` )

The index configuration for this field. If unset, field indexing will revert to the configuration defined by the `  ancestorField  ` . To explicitly remove all indexes for this field, specify an index config with an empty list of indexes.

## IndexConfig

The index configuration for this field.

Fields

`  indexes[]  `

`  object ( Index  ` )

The indexes supported for this field.

`  usesAncestorConfig  `

`  boolean  `

Output only. When true, the `  Field  ` 's index configuration is set from the configuration specified by the `  ancestorField  ` . When false, the `  Field  ` 's index configuration is defined explicitly.

`  ancestorField  `

`  string  `

Output only. Specifies the resource name of the `  Field  ` from which this field's index configuration is set (when `  usesAncestorConfig  ` is true), or from which it *would* be set if this field had no index configuration (when `  usesAncestorConfig  ` is false).

`  reverting  `

`  boolean  `

Output only When true, the `  Field  ` 's index configuration is in the process of being reverted. Once complete, the index config will transition to the same state as the field specified by `  ancestorField  ` , at which point `  usesAncestorConfig  ` will be `  true  ` and `  reverting  ` will be `  false  ` .
