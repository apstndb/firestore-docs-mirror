Fields

`  explainOptions  `

`  object ( ExplainOptions  ` )

Optional. Explain options for the query. If set, additional query statistics will be returned. If not, only query results will be returned.

Union field `  query_type  ` . The query to run. `  query_type  ` can be only one of the following:

`  structuredQuery  `

`  object ( StructuredQuery  ` )

A structured query.

Union field `  consistency_selector  ` . The consistency mode for this transaction. If not set, defaults to strong consistency. `  consistency_selector  ` can be only one of the following:

`  transaction  `

`  string ( bytes format)  `

Run the query within an already active transaction.

The value here is the opaque transaction ID to execute the query in.

A base64-encoded string.

`  newTransaction  `

`  object ( TransactionOptions  ` )

Starts a new transaction and reads the documents. Defaults to a read-only transaction. The new transaction ID will be returned as the first response in the stream.

`  readTime  `

`  string ( Timestamp  ` format)

Reads documents as they were at the given time.

This must be a microsecond precision timestamp within the past one hour, or if Point-in-Time Recovery is enabled, can additionally be a whole minute timestamp within the past 7 days.

Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"  ` , `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"  ` or `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30"  ` .

### Response body

The response for `  Firestore.RunQuery  ` .

If successful, the response body contains data with the following structure:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>JSON representation</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

  &quot;document&quot;: {
    object (Document)
  },
  &quot;readTime&quot;: string,
  &quot;skippedResults&quot;: integer,
  &quot;explainMetrics&quot;: {
    object (ExplainMetrics)
  },

  // Union field continuation_selector can be only one of the following:
  &quot;done&quot;: boolean
  // End of list of possible types for union field continuation_selector.
}</code></pre></td>

Fields

`  transaction  `

`  string ( bytes format)  `

The transaction that was started as part of this request. Can only be set in the first response, and only if `  RunQueryRequest.new_transaction  ` was set in the request. If set, no other fields will be set in this response.

A base64-encoded string.

`  document  `

`  object ( Document  ` )

A query result, not set when reporting partial progress.

`  readTime  `

`  string ( Timestamp  ` format)

The time at which the document was read. This may be monotonically increasing; in this case, the previous documents in the result stream are guaranteed not to have changed between their `  readTime  ` and this one.

If the query returns no results, a response with `  readTime  ` and no `  document  ` will be sent, and this represents the time at which the query was run.

Uses RFC 3339, where generated output will always be Z-normalized and use 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional digits. Offsets other than "Z" are also accepted. Examples: `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23Z"  ` , `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23.045123456Z"  ` or `  "2014-10-02T15:01:23+05:30"  ` .

`  skippedResults  `

`  integer  `

The number of results that have been skipped due to an offset between the last response and the current response.

`  explainMetrics  `

`  object ( ExplainMetrics  ` )

Query explain metrics. This is only present when the `  RunQueryRequest.explain_options  ` is provided, and it is sent only once with the last response in the stream.

Union field `  continuation_selector  ` . The continuation mode for the query. If present, it indicates the current query response stream has finished. This can be set with or without a `  document  ` present, but when set, no more results are returned. `  continuation_selector  ` can be only one of the following:

`  done  `

`  boolean  `

If present, Firestore has completely finished the request and no more documents will be returned.
