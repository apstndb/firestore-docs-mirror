Fields

`  name  `

`  string  `

The server-assigned name, which is only unique within the same service that originally returns it. If you use the default HTTP mapping, the `  name  ` should be a resource name ending with `  operations/{unique_id}  ` .

`  metadata  `

`  object  `

Service-specific metadata associated with the operation. It typically contains progress information and common metadata such as create time. Some services might not provide such metadata. Any method that returns a long-running operation should document the metadata type, if any.

An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field `  "@type"  ` contains a URI identifying the type. Example: `  { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }  ` .

`  done  `

`  boolean  `

If the value is `  false  ` , it means the operation is still in progress. If `  true  ` , the operation is completed, and either `  error  ` or `  response  ` is available.

Union field `  result  ` . The operation result, which can be either an `  error  ` or a valid `  response  ` . If `  done  ` == `  false  ` , neither `  error  ` nor `  response  ` is set. If `  done  ` == `  true  ` , exactly one of `  error  ` or `  response  ` can be set. Some services might not provide the result. `  result  ` can be only one of the following:

`  error  `

`  object ( Status  ` )

The error result of the operation in case of failure or cancellation.

`  response  `

`  object  `

The normal, successful response of the operation. If the original method returns no data on success, such as `  Delete  ` , the response is `  google.protobuf.Empty  ` . If the original method is standard `  Get  ` / `  Create  ` / `  Update  ` , the response should be the resource. For other methods, the response should have the type `  XxxResponse  ` , where `  Xxx  ` is the original method name. For example, if the original method name is `  TakeSnapshot()  ` , the inferred response type is `  TakeSnapshotResponse  ` .

An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field `  "@type"  ` contains a URI identifying the type. Example: `  { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }  ` .

## Status

The `  Status  ` type defines a logical error model that is suitable for different programming environments, including REST APIs and RPC APIs. It is used by [gRPC](https://github.com/grpc) . Each `  Status  ` message contains three pieces of data: error code, error message, and error details.

You can find out more about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors) .

Fields

`  code  `

`  integer  `

The status code, which should be an enum value of `  google.rpc.Code  ` .

`  message  `

`  string  `

A developer-facing error message, which should be in English. Any user-facing error message should be localized and sent in the `  google.rpc.Status.details  ` field, or localized by the client.

`  details[]  `

`  object  `

A list of messages that carry the error details. There is a common set of message types for APIs to use.

An object containing fields of an arbitrary type. An additional field `  "@type"  ` contains a URI identifying the type. Example: `  { "id": 1234, "@type": "types.example.com/standard/id" }  ` .
